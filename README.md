# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Dan C**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Summary

**YugiCard-view** is an android app that that displays a scrollable list of cards from the Yu-Gi-Oh! API

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü§ûüÉèüòé**

## Notes

In this unit, I learned how to implement a RecyclerView to show a scrolling list of data from an API request. Additionally, this project can be thought of
as a continuation of my earlier project called **"Yugi-droh"**, which instead pulls data one element at a time from an API.
